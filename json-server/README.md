# Sample mock server

This is an example of a mock server which can be used together with sample application. It relies on awesome [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) which is a mock server which takes 30 seconds to setup and requires 0 lines of code.

Of course it is possible to use Endpoint2mock2 with any other kind of server.

## How to start it

Two steps. First, make sure it is installed by running:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Second, run it:

```
sh startServer.sh
```

After that sample application will be able to use it.
